[LTX Video](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video) from Genmo.

*LTX-Video is the first DiT-based video generation model capable of generating high-quality videos in real-time. It produces 24 FPS videos at a 768x512 resolution faster than they can be watched. Trained on a large-scale dataset of diverse videos, the model generates high-resolution videos with realistic and varied content. We provide a model for both text-to-video as well as image + text-to-video usecases.*

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers.md) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading.md#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
